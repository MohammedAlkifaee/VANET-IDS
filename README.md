# Trust-Gated Hybrid IDS for VANETs (Practical Implementation) — University of Kufa

This repository contains the **practical (implementation) side** of a Master’s thesis project: a **Trust-Gated Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs).

Core idea:
- **OBU lightweight screening** (fast plausibility checks)
- **RSU model inference** (ML-based detection)
- **Trust-gated fusion** (adaptive decision based on trust)

> Research/academic use only.
